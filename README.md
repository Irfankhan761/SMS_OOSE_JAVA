# School Management System

The School Management System is a Java GUI application designed to manage and organize various aspects of a school's administrative tasks. The application follows the GRASP principles to ensure a clean and maintainable design.

## Features

- **Student Management**: Add, view, update, and delete student records like attendance, and marks.
- **Course Management**: Manage courses, view course details, and assign courses to students.
- **Teacher Management**: Keep track of teacher information, and assign teachers to courses.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Record and view student attendance for each class.
- **Grades and Report Cards**: Manage student grades and generate report cards.

## GRASP Principles

The project adheres to the General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns (GRASP) principles, promoting a well-structured and modular design.

1. **Information Expert**: Classes responsible for a piece of information should contain that information.
2. **Creator**: A class should be responsible for creating instances of its own objects.
3. **Controller**: A class that handles system events should be a controller.
4. **Low Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between classes to promote reusability and flexibility.
5. **High Cohesion**: Keep related behaviors in one class to enhance readability and maintainability.
6. **Polymorphism**: Encourage the use of polymorphism to handle different types of objects.
